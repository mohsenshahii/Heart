Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm 
that can be used in several classification tasks. Typical
applications of Naive Bayes are classification of documents,
filtering spam, prediction and so on. This algorithm is based on the 
discoveries of Thomas Bayes and hence its name. 

The name “Naïve” is used because the algorithm incorporates
features in its model that are independent of each other.
Any modifications in the value of one feature do not directly
impact the value of any other feature of the algorithm. The
main advantage of the Naïve Bayes algorithm is that it is a
simple yet powerful algorithm.

It is based on the probabilistic model where the
algorithm can be coded easily, and predictions did
quickly in real-time. Hence this algorithm is the typical
choice to solve real-world problems as it can be tuned to 
respond to user requests instantly. But before we dive deep
into Naïve Bayes and Gaussian Naïve Bayes, we must know what 
is meant by conditional probability.
