These algorithms improve the prediction power by converting a
number of weak learners to strong learners.

The principle behind boosting algorithms is first we built 
a model on the training dataset, then a second model is built 
to rectify the errors present in the first model. This
procedure is continued until and unless the errors are
minimized, and the dataset is predicted correctly.
