LDA reduces the dimension by maximizing the separability among each feature. It works
by creating a new feature (you could see it as a line) and projecting all the other 
features on that line. During transformation, LDA attempts to maximize the distance 
between the mean of every feature. Also, the scattered amongst the data points need 
to be minimized. By doing these, there would be a minimal overlap of data points on 
the new axis. Less overlap means there will be minimal misclassification, and by 
extension, means there will be better classification results. 

LDA is a supervised learning classifier which means it requires both the features 
and the labels (or X and y).
