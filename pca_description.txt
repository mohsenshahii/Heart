Principal Component Analysis is one of the most popular feature reduction techniques.
It finds a way of reducing the number of features by finding a smaller combination of
features that best summarises the initial feature. PCA basically uses metrics such as 
variance and reconstruction error when performing this transformation. It attempted to
maximize variance and minimize reconstruction error. PCA projects the initial dataset
to a set of orthogonal axes. Datapoints that are highly correlated are clustered 
together in the new axes. These axes are then ranked based on their order of importance.

PCA is classified as an unsupervised learning algorithm and thus, does not require the
labels of the data. In fact, PCA can be used to reduce the dataset dimension to 1,
where the classification is done already.
