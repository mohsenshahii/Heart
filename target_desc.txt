As is obvious the target variable isn't balanced. A huge number of observations (%91)  
have value 'no' while a small proportion having value 'yes'. I tried to down sample the dataset 
so the percentage of positive and negative observations be equal. Suprisingly, downsampling reduced the 
prediction accuracy in all three ML models. so I decided to use original dataset instead of downsampled one.
