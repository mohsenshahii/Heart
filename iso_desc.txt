PCA and LDA methods considered above reduce features by finding the relationship between features 
after projecting them on an orthogonal plane. LLE (explored in the next section below) is quite 
different in the sense that it does not use linear relationships but also accommodates non-linear 
relationships in the features. Isomap works by using a type of learning called manifold learning. 

Manifold learning summarises the data to a smaller number of features. This time however, the
generalization is made to be such that it is sensitive to any form of non-linear structure in 
the dataset. 

Isomap creates a lower-dimensional embedding of the data while maintaining the geodesic (or mean)
distance between all points in the dataset.
